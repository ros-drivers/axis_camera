Overview
========

This ROS_ package provides an `Axis network camera`_ driver, written
in Python.

ROS wiki documentation: `axis_camera`_.

This driver is under active development.  Its ROS interfaces are
relatively stable, but may still change.  

There is no released code API.

**Warning**::

  The master branch normally contains code being tested for the next
  ROS release.  It does not always work with previous ROS distributions.
  Sometimes, it may not work at all.

Each official release is tagged in the repository. The `change
history`_ describes every version.
