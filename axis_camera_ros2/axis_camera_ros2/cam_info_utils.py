    :class:`CameraInfoManager` provides ROS CameraInfo support for
    Python camera drivers. It handles the `sensor_msgs/SetCameraInfo`_
    service requests, saving and restoring `sensor_msgs/CameraInfo`_
    data.

    :param cname: camera name.
    :param url: Uniform Resource Locator for camera calibration data.
    :param namespace: Optional ROS namespace prefix for the service
           name.  If a namespace is specified, the '/' separator
           required between it and ``set_camera_info`` will be
           supplied automatically.

    .. describe:: str(camera_info_manager_obj)

       :returns: String representation of :class:`CameraInfoManager` object.

    **ROS Service**

    - set_camera_info (`sensor_msgs/SetCameraInfo`_) stores
                      calibration information

    Typically, these service requests are made by a calibration
    package, such as:

    - http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration

    The calling node *must* invoke `rospy.spin()` in some thread, so
    :class:`CameraInfoManager` gets called to handle arriving service
    requests.

    If a driver handles multiple cameras, it should use the
    ``namespace`` parameter to declare separate
    :class:`CameraInfoManager` instances for each one, as in this
    stereo example::

      left_ci = CameraInfoManager(cname='left_camera', namespace='left')
      right_ci = CameraInfoManager(cname='right_camera', namespace='right')

    **Camera Name**

    The device driver sets a camera name via the
    :class:`CameraInfoManager` constructor or the
    :py:meth:`setCameraName` method.  This name is written when
    CameraInfo is saved, and checked when data are loaded, with a
    warning logged if the name read does not match.

    Syntax: a camera name contains any combination of alphabetic,
            numeric and '_' characters.  Case is significant.

    Camera drivers may use any syntactically valid name they please.
    Where possible, it is best for the name to be unique to the
    device, such as a GUID, or the make, model and serial number.  Any
    parameters that affect calibration, such as resolution, focus,
    zoom, etc., may also be included in the name, uniquely identifying
    each CameraInfo file.

    The camera name can be resolved as part of the URL, allowing
    direct access to device-specific calibration information.

    **Uniform Resource Locator**

    The location for getting and saving calibration data is expressed
    by Uniform Resource Locator.  The driver defines a URL via the
    :class:`CameraInfoManager` constructor or the :py:meth:`setURL`
    method.  Many drivers provide a `~camera_info_url` parameter so
    users may customize this URL, but that is handled outside this
    class.

    Camera calibration information is stored in YAML format.

    Example URL syntax:

    - `file:///full/path/to/local/file.yaml`
    - `package://camera_info_manager_py/tests/test_calibration.yaml`
    - `package://ros_package_name/calibrations/camera3.yaml`

    The `file:` URL specifies a full path name in the local system.
    The `package:` URL is handled the same as `file:`, except the path
    name is resolved relative to the location of the named ROS
    package, which must be reachable via `$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`.

    The URL may contain substitution variables delimited by `${...}`,
    including:

    - ${NAME} resolved to the current camera name defined by the
              device driver.
    - ${ROS_HOME} resolved to the `$ROS_HOME` environment variable if
                  defined, `~/.ros` if not.

    Resolution is done in a single pass through the URL string.
    Variable values containing substitutable strings are not resolved
    recursively.  Unrecognized variable names are treated literally
    with no substitution, but an error is logged.

    Examples with variable substitution:

    - `package://my_cameras/calibrations/${NAME}.yaml`
    - `file://${ROS_HOME}/camera_info/left_front_camera.yaml`

    The default URL is:

    - `file://${ROS_HOME}/camera_info/${NAME}.yaml`

    If that file exists, its contents are used. Any new calibration
    will be stored there, missing parent directories being created if
    necessary and possible.

    **Loading Calibration Data**

    Unlike the `C++ camera_info_manager`_, this Python implementation
    loads nothing until the :py:meth:`loadCameraInfo` method is
    called.  It is an error to call :py:meth:`getCameraInfo`, or
    :py:meth:`isCalibrated` before that is done.

    If the URL or camera name changes, :py:meth:`loadCameraInfo` must
    be called again before the data are accessible.
